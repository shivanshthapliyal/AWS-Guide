## General

* * *


### Amazon History:

* 2003 - Chris Pinkman and Benjamin Black presented a paper on what Amazon's internal infrastructure should look like and suggested sellingit as a service

## Global Infrastructure:

### Regions Vs. Availability Zones:

A Region is a geographical area which consists of at least 2 Availability Zone's or AZ's. An AZ is simply a data center.

* [14 Regions with 38 Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)

* Projected to spin up 4 additional regions, with 9 additional AZ's over the next year

* Edge locations are CDN endpoints for CloudFront. Currently there are over 50 edge locations. Not the same as an AZ

* Maximum Response time for Business is 1 hour

* Services such as CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk, Autoscaling, and OpsWorks are free however resources generated by these services are not free

### Consolidated Billing:

* Accounts roll for customers:

    * Paying account is independent, can not access resources of the other accounts

    * Linked accounts are independent from one another

    * Currently there is a limit of 20 linked accounts for consolidated billing (soft limit)

    * One bill per AWS account

    * Easy to track charges and allocate costs between linked accounts

    * Volume pricing discount

    * Resources across all linked accounts are tallied, and billing is applied collectively to allow bigger discounts

## Web Application Firewall

> AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP(S) requests that are forwarded to an **Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API.**

* Control access to content

* Configure filtering rules to allow/deny traffic:

    * IP addresses

    * Query string parameters

        * [http://example.com/page?foo=bar&abc=xyz&baz=123](http://example.com/page?foo=bar&abc=xyz&baz=123)

    * SQL query injection

* Blocked traffic returns HTTP 403 Forbidden

(You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.)
